This is a simple To-Do List application built with React and Bootstrap. It allows you to create, manage, and store your tasks locally within your browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter your task in the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
- **Task Management**: Each task has a checkbox to mark it as completed, an edit button to update the task description, and a delete button to remove it from the list.
- **Local Storage**: The app utilizes local storage to persist your tasks even after you refresh the page. This ensures your data is not lost and remains accessible during your current browsing session.
- **Hover Effect**: Tasks have a subtle hover effect to enhance user experience.
